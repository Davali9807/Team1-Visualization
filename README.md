# Team1-Visualization
This recopilation in GitHub is my first one and is not maybe the best, the first part of the challenge, the computation of HOURS was done by Alan Minero while the rest of the graphs was developed by me (Diana Vázquez) with some help from Erik Alcala and Gloria Anahí, the ideas and discussions where carried out between the four of us in order to have different points of view
The final code is in the file NotebookKaggleFinalCode because everything was developed from the notebook in Kaggle.
Thanks for the opportunity and the amazing experience.
